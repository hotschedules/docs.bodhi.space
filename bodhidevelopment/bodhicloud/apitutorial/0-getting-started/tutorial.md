Bodhi Cloud API Tutorials
---------

# Overview
The Bodhi Cloud API is secure environment where you can store your data and define secure access to various users based on permissions through a concept called Profiles.  Profiles are how you associate a user with your data, you can grant full, read, write and update privileges to your data using the Bodhi Cloud API.  

These tutorials are designed to show a user how to log in, see all the users in your namespace, create a type, delete that type, show how to query your namespace and see what users have access to your namespace and see what kind of access those users have.

# Getting Started
These tutorials are intended to work within the namespace indicated in each of the sections Logging In, Accessing your namespace, Creating a new Type with attributes and Properties, Deleting that type, Creating a new User and giving them a profile, Creating a New Store and will reference the data and users set up in that namespace.  In some cases, the tutorials depend on data and users that were already setup by the Bodhi Team.  In other cases, the users and profiles will be created as part of completing the tutorial.
